ðŸ”¥ What is a Virtual Environment in Python?
- A virtual environment is an isolated Python environment where you can install packages separately for each project â€” without affecting the global (system-wide) Python installation.


ðŸ›  Step 1: Create venv folder (recommended: .venv)
python -m venv .venv

ðŸ›  Step 2: Activate the virtual environment
.venv\Scripts\activate

ðŸ›  Step 3: Install packages (inside venv)
pip install flask

ðŸ“¦ What is requirements.txt?
requirements.txt is a text file that stores a list of packages your project depends on, along with their exact versions.

ðŸ›  Step 4: Create a requirements.txt file
After installing packages (e.g., Flask, Django, etc.) inside your virtual environment:-
pip freeze > requirements.txt
âœ… Use pip freeze > requirements.txt after adding/removing packages

ðŸ›  Step 4: How to Exit Virtual Environment
deactivate



Create virtual env-->   python -m venv .venv

Activate:	.venv\Scripts\activate
Install packages:	pip install flask
Save dependencies:	pip freeze > requirements.txt
Exit venv:	deactivate

Repeat again whenever install packages



ðŸ“¥ Installing from requirements.txt
If someone clones your project or you're moving it to another system:-
pip install -r requirements.txt
This installs all packages listed in the file with exact versions.
