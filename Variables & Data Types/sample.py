# Programming
Programming means writing instructions for the computer to perform specific tasks.
Example: making a calculator, a game, or a website.

----------------------------------------
# Code
Code is the actual written instructions using a programming language.
Example:
print("Hello, Python!")  ‚Üê This is a Python code.

----------------------------------------
# Compiler
A compiler translates the entire program into machine code at once, before running it.
Languages like C and C++ use compilers.
Fast execution, but shows errors only after compiling.

----------------------------------------
# Interpreter
An interpreter reads and runs code line-by-line.
Python is an interpreter-based language.
Easier for beginners, shows errors line-by-line, easy to debugging, but slightly slower than compiler.

# ----------------------------------------
# High-Level Language
These are programming languages that are easy to read and write.
They are closer to human language.
Examples: Python, Java, C++
Easy syntax and portable (runs on multiple systems).

----------------------------------------
# Low-Level Language
These languages are closer to the hardware or machine.
Examples: Assembly Language, Machine Code (0s and 1s)
Very fast and gives more control over hardware, but harder to learn.

----------------------------------------
# Python
Python is a high-level, interpreter-based language.
It is simple, readable, and perfect for beginners.
Used in web development, data science, AI, automation, and more.
Has a large number of libraries and a huge community.
