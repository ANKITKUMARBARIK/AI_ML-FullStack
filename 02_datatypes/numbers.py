ðŸ”¢ Numbers in Python
Python supports multiple numeric data types to represent different types of numbers.
They are all immutable, meaning their value canâ€™t be changed in-place.

- Integers
- Booleans
- Real Numbers - Float, Decimal
- Complex - Used for complex numbers with real and imaginary parts. Rarely used in backend, more in scientific/math apps

+, -, *, /, //, %, **
