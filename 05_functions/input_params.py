Order Invoice Generator
You are building an Order Invoice Generator system for a restaurant. The function should be versatile enough to accept a customer's name, a flexible number of ordered items, and a set of dynamic extra charges (like tax, service charge, etc.).

Your Tasks:

- Function: 
generate_invoice(customer_name: str, *items: str, **charges: float) -> str
customer_name: optional; defaults to "Guest" if not provided.
*items: an arbitrary number of strings representing food items ordered.
**charges: keyword arguments representing different charges like tax=50.0, service=20.0, delivery=15.0, etc.

- Invoice Structure:
Header: Invoice for <customer_name>
Items Section (only if items are provided):
Line: Items:
Each item on its own line with format: - <item_name>
Charges Section (only if charges are provided):
Line: Charges:
Each charge on its own line with format: <Charge_name>: <amount>
At the end, the display Total Amount Due: â‚¹<total>.

- Important Notes:
Sum only the values from *charges for total.
Items are only for listing, not costing.
Charge names should be capitalized (e.g., tax becomes Tax)
Use \n to join all lines into a single string

Examples:

# Example 1: Full invoice with items and charges
generate_invoice("Amit", "Burger", "Fries", tax=50.0, service=20.0)
# Output:
# Invoice for Amit:
# Items:
# - Burger  
# - Fries
# Charges:
# Tax: 50.0
# Service: 20.0
# Total Amount Due: 70.0

# Example 2: Only charges, no items
generate_invoice("Riya", tax=30.0)
# Output:
# Invoice for Riya:
# Charges:
# Tax: 30.0
# Total Amount Due: 30.0

# Example 3: Default customer, no items or charges
generate_invoice()
# Output:
# Invoice for Guest:
# Total Amount Due: 0.0

# Example 4: Only items, no charges
generate_invoice("John", "Pizza", "Coke")
# Output:
# Invoice for John:
# Items:
# - Pizza
# - Coke
# Total Amount Due: 0.0
